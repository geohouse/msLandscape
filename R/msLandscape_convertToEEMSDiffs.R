#' msLandscape_convertToEEMSDiffs is a utility function to convert \emph{ms} output for use with \emph{EEMS}
#' 
#' This function is the second processing step required to convert raw \emph{ms} simulation output into the
#' pairwise genetic differences format required by \emph{EEMS}. The accompanying Python script 
#' ghostLands_msOutputConvertFor_SpaceMix_EEMS_for_msLandscape.py takes the raw \emph{ms} simulation results
#' and converts them to the intermediate '.4eemsdiffs' files. This msLandscape_convertToEEMSDiffs
#' function then converts those '4eemsdiffs' files to '.diffs' files for use with EEMS.
#' 
#' @param dirWith_4eemsdiffs_files The path to the directory containing the .4eemsdiffs files to convert to .diffs files for 
#' EEMS using pairwise genetic differences between each individual at each locus. NOTE - the Python msLandscape script to 
#' convert ms output into SpaceMix input and EEMS .4eemsdiffs files needs to be run before this script. 
#' @return None
#' @name msLandscape_convertToEEMSDiffs
#' @export


# This is working correctly as part of msLandscape pending further tests 031717. Works correctly
# with diploid tests with uneven sampling and extra -e flags in flag file (this script really sees none of that
# though - it's already taken care of.) 031717.

# This is a stand alone version of this converter, where it is run in a dir that contains multiple .4eemsdiffs
# intermediate files that have already been converted from the raw ms output, and here each input file is
# converted into the .diffs file needed for EEMS to run.

# There are no external arguments to this script, but need to make sure the path to the dir with the .4eemsdiffs
# files to convert, and the structure of the parser to recover the iteration number from the .4eemsdiffs file names
# are correct (both specified below).

# This calculates the matrix of average pairwise genetic distance for use in EEMS (calculated
# following the method used for EEMS) using the same dataset format as needed for
# running SpaceMix in R (which is convenient!). Use the
# /Users/geoffreyhouse/Documents/Python_programming/Landscape_Genetics/ghostLands_Python/ghostLands_msOutput_convertForSpaceMix.py
# script to convert the ms simulated output into the format needed here for easy R importing and manipulation.

        # D[i,j] = (1/ #SNP loci) * summation of m (from 1 to # SNP loci) of (X[i,m] - X[j,m] ^2)

        # and D is the pairwise comparison entry for row i and row j of X, encoded as row i and col j of D.
        
        # This input files is csv and has already been converted from the raw ms output to SpaceMix format
