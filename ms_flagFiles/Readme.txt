These are all of the ms flag files (ms command line arguments) used to generate each of the tested scenarios (varying effective migration rates and the number of individuals sampled per population) that are presented in the main manuscript and the supplemental figures. The ms flag files for the constant migration, migration barrier, and long-distance migration scenarios are also available as Supplemental text S1-S3 associated with the paper.
