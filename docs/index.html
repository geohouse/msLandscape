            <em>msLandscape</em> is a toolbox that enables the quick, largely automatic generation and visualization of customized landscapes to simulate with the popular coalescent simulator <em>ms</em>.
        </h3>
        
        <p>Created by Geoffrey House and Matthew Hahn (Indiana University)</p>
        
        <p>
            The <em>msLandscape</em> toolbox consists of the stand alone R package <em>msLandscape</em> as well as Python and bash shell scripts. All of them work seamlessly together so you can focus on creating the landscape you want to simulate.

        <p>
            For an overview of what <em>msLandscape</em> can do and how to use it to generate and simulate custom landscape shapes, see the guide here:

        </p>
        <p>
            For more detail about the <em>msLandscape</em> workflow and how it easily interfaces with downstream analysis programs to infer patterns of past migration across the landscape, including unbundled principal components (<em>un-PC</em>), see the schematic diagram here: <a href="./msLandscapeSchematic.html"><em>msLandscape </em> workflow.</a>

            To run <em>msLandscape</em>, you will need to have three things installed on our computer (and it makes it easier if they are on your <em>$PATH</em>.) They are (with links):

         <strong>Above:</strong> <em>msLandscape</em> makes it easier to use <em>ms</em> for landscape simulations by automatically creating and editing the contents of the underlying <em>ms</em> flag file (base layer) and then plotting the resulting lansdcape (overlay), so you can focus more on building the landscape configuration you want.

        <!--<p><em>msLandscape</em> automatically constructs customized <em>ms</em> flag files to match your landscape configuration and then plots them. Combined with its automated ability to 'sculpt' the landscape into different shapes, -->
