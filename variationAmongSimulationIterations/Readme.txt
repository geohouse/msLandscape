These are visualizations from each of the 100 independent simulation iterations used for each of the three main migration scenarios presented in the manuscript (constant migration, migration barrier, and long-distance migration). The visualizations shown in the manuscript are averages calculated across these 100 independent simulation iterations (Figures 3-5). Generally the variance among independent iterations is moderate.
