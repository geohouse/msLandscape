# *msLandscape*
A toolbox to streamline the creation of landscape-scale simulations using the coalescent simulator *ms*
*msLandscape* comprises an R package and a toolbox of other scripts that work seamlessly together with the R package.

For a full tutorial on how to use *msLandscape* to automatically generate landscape-scale *ms* flag files and the workflow
for editing and 'sculpting' these landscapes to meet the desired shape, sampling patterns, and migration patterns for the
landscape, see the linked tutorial <a href="https://github.com/hahnlab/msLandscape/docs/msLandscape_plotSculpt_tutorial_032917.html/">here</a>. 

To install the R package easily, make sure the devtools package is installed (using the command ```install.packages("devtools")``` in R if necessary). In R, then type ```devtools::install_github("hahnlab/msLandscape")```. The package should load automatically.

To use the toolbox of other scripts, download them and for ease of use make them excecutable.
